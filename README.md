# Project 2: US Vehicle Accidents EDA (Python)

This repository is for the analysis done on the Kaggle: US Vehicle Accidents dataset. Below you will find an overview of the data, code, and results. The goal of this project was to perform an exploratory data analysis (which included the use of GeoPandas) and to prepare (i.e., clean and impute) for future predictive modeling use.

## Vehicle Accidents Dataset

The dataset was gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) and, at the time of collection, spanned from February 2016 to December 2020. The dataset contained 47 variables and 2,906,610 accident records.

### Variables

`ID`, `Severity`, `Start_Time`, `End_Time`, `Start_Lat`, `Start_Lng`, `End_Lat`, `End_Lng`, `Distance(mi)`, `Description`, `Number`, `Street`, `Side`, `City`, `County`, `State`, `Zipcode`, `Country`, `Timezone`, `Airport_Code`, `Weather_Timestamp`, `Temperature(F)`, `Wind_Chill(F)`, `Humidity(%)`, `Pressure(in)`, `Visibility(mi)`, `Wind_Direction`, `Wind_Speed(mph)`, `Precipitation(in)`, `Weather_Condition`, `Amenity`, `Bump`, `Crossing`, `Give_Way`, `Junction`, `No_Exit`, `Railway`, `Roundabout`, `Station`, `Stop`, `Traffic_Calming`, `Traffic_Signal`, `Turning_Loop`, `Sunrise_Sunset`, `Civil_Twilight`, `Nautical_Twilight`, `Astronomical_Twilight`

### Application

This project can help keep people informed about the current status of COVID-19. A website or app can be created as an interface. The query process and Tableau dashboard creation can be automated so that a user may select the region they are interested in and the variables they want to view.

Specifically, the visualizations can help businesses, schools, and politicians make informed policy decisions for implementing closures or lockdowns to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The hospitalization and ICU patient forecast visualizations can be used by medical institutions to ensure equipment and staffing needs are met.
